# PULSE-MODULATION
using matlab implement PAM PWM PPM
-PAM (pulse amplitude modulation):
how to implement for any signal 
and draw the spectrum of signal 
finally demodulate the signal 
-PWM (pulse width modulation):
how to implement for any signal 
and draw the spectrum of signal 
finally demodulate the signal
